# Severless testing

> The 'application' consists of an http endpoint that will create a message on
  a queue based on the input data. Another function will take the message off
  the queue, process the body of the message and update a file in an existing
  s3 bucket that has another function that will load it to view.

##Â Endpoints

- `submit` - creates message from input
- `process` - updates the s3 file
- `view` - view contents of the s3 file
